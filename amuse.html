    <p>Stand up comedy can definitley be a hit or a miss, but sometimes I like to watch videos like this with people in front of a live audience doing comedy!</p>

    <h2>Old Laughs</h2>
    <p>Growing up, i used to love watching Americas Funniest Home videos on TV with my family. We would pop popcorn and make a whole movie night out of it. Even though we used to watch it on TV, there is a website you can use to watch old videos!</p>
