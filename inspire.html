<h2>Why She Inspires Me!</h2>
<h3>
  Ruth Bader Ginsburg was an American lawyer and jurist who served as an associate justice of the Supreme Court of the United States from 1993 until her death in 2020.

<p>
  RBG inspires me because she persuaded the all-male Supreme Court, one case at a time, to start recognizing the constitutional barrier against discrimination on the basis of sex. She is a feminist icon who fought for womens rights when no one else was.
